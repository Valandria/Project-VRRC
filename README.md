Project VRRC is the current development files for the FivePD project Valandria's Rapid Response Callouts.  While technically Rapid Response is an active server, the project of the same name is focused on revamping and extending current open source callouts, as well as creating other open source callouts to provide for the community as a whole.  Because of the vision for the server, the eventual vision for the callouts will probably not occur until after FivePD 2.0 comes out, however there should be a handful of each type of callout before release.

Each callout will be given a location designation;
- NC - Anything outside of the City, including the power station and that general area.
- SC - Anything within City limits.
- L - ‘Local’ will spawn within a set distance of the individual accepting the callout.

Some callouts will also come with additional designations depending on the nature of the callout;
- MED - Callout is medical in nature.
- FD - Callout will require heavy equipment, search and rescue, or the risk for fire.
- SWAT - Callout is designed for SWAT responses.
- MP - Callout is designed for Military Police.
- TW - Callout will require a tow truck.
- TI - Callout will require to relocate individuals via Taxi to a set location.

Please note that some of the callouts uploaded may not properly function or are not fully completed.

All callouts will be continuously updated as time permits and will eventually be converted over to FivePD 2.0 once the API is released.  Due to time limitations and this being a solo project, it will be a slow process getting each callout updated and created.
